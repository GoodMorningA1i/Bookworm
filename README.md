### Built With

Xcode, SwiftUI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install XCode

### Getting the files onto your computer

Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or GitHub Desktop. 

For example, this is how using git could potentially look like: 
```
https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
```

You should replace `your_username` and `project_name` respectively.

### Running the project

1. Get started by opening up the project in XCode by clicking on the file ending with `.xcodeproj`.
2. Once the project is open in Xcode, you can select a device (ex. iPhone 15) and run it on a simulator by pressing Cmd + R or clicking on the play button at the top-left corner of the screen.

## Acknowledgements

This project is from a tutorial series provided by Hacking With Swift. The tutorial series is called 100 Days of SwiftUI. Part 3 introduces challenges where I made additions with my own code.
